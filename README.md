# Multi-Paradigm-Programming

This Repository consists of a number of programming exercises in both the Python and C programming languages. Each exercise is organised into a weekly folder, with both procedural and object oriented programming styles used. There are no pre-requesites to running these exercise files, simply run them in a supported IDE or from command line.
